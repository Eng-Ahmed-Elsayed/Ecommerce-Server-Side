## Description

During a conversation with a friend working in a mall, I identified a significant challenge affecting customer engagement. Many customers were missing out on the latest discounts, offers, and new collections, expressing frustration over the difficulty of finding products on the mall's Facebook page.

In response to this challenge, I envisioned a transformative solution: a dynamic and user-friendly E-commerce web application. Armed with my expertise in Angular and .NET, I proposed a platform that not only addresses the current issues but also elevates the overall shopping experience. The application aims to provide real-time updates on discounts, offers, and new collections, ensuring customers stay informed and engaged.

My vision extends beyond basic updates â€“ users will have the ability to effortlessly search and filter products, streamlining their shopping journey. As an E-commerce Full Stack developer, my role is to orchestrate the entire development process, from crafting an intuitive frontend using Angular to implementing a robust backend with .NET. This solution not only addresses the immediate concerns but also sets the stage for a modern, responsive, and customer-centric digital shopping experience, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
